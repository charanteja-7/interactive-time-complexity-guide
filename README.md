# Interactive Guide to Time Complexity

## Project Description
This single-page interactive web application provides a visual and engaging way to learn about algorithm time complexities. Built with vanilla JavaScript, Chart.js for data visualization, and Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, it allows users to:
* **Visualize Growth Rates:** See how different Big O complexities (O(1), O(log N), O(N), O(N log N), O(N²), O(2ⁿ)) scale with increasing input size through an interactive line chart.
* **Deep Dive into Complexities:** Explore detailed explanations, common examples, and code snippets for each major time complexity.
* **Understand Practical Implications:** Refer to a guide that relates input size to acceptable time complexities for typical coding challenge scenarios.

The application is designed to transform passive learning into an active, exploratory experience, making abstract time complexity concepts tangible and easier to grasp.

## Features
* **Interactive Growth Chart:** Dynamically rendered line chart showing complexity growth.
* **Detailed Explanations:** Clickable tabs to reveal specific information for each Big O notation.
* **Code Examples:** Illustrative code snippets for each complexity type.
* **Practical Feasibility Table:** A quick reference for choosing algorithms based on input constraints.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Clean UI/UX:** Minimalistic design with a calm color palette (Slate & Amber) for enhanced readability.

## How to Use/Run
This is a single-page HTML application. To run it:
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/interactive-time-complexity-guide.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/interactive-time-complexity-guide.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd interactive-time-complexity-guide
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. (No local server is required as all assets are loaded via CDN.)

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Structure of the web application.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for responsive styling.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For all interactive logic, DOM manipulation, and data handling.
* **Chart.js:** JavaScript library for rendering interactive data visualizations (line chart).
